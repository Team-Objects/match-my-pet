          </h5>
          <p>I grew up in Iowa but am now living in Washington state. Attending the University of Iowa, it took me four major changes and building my own computer to find my passion for technology and coding specifically. After finishing my Associates Degree I decided to attend a Code Fellows in order to progress my techincal abilities in the most efficient way possible. I want to be well versed in everything technology and that is why I believe trying new things and putting myself in uncomfortable situations will allow me to become an expert in programming and technology in general. I have a love for learning that makes new challenges exciting for me.

          <h5>About Katharine</h5>
          <p>Hi! I'm Katharine (she/her). I live in Olympia, Washington with my husband Dave and our cat Greg. Before starting my Code Fellows journey I worked in grants management for a state agency for a few years, as well as in the non-profit field and in food service. After dabbling in some coding tutorials and workshops I found myself thinking about code when I would open an email or log in to a website. I want to understand how something I interact with everyday works.</p>

          <h5>About Vida</h5>
          <p>Mellow greetings from North Carolina! I’m Vida (she/her), Mom to four furkids and pandemic-inspired
            homeschooler of two (nephews) with a passion for Star Trek, canine rescue, and learning coding. My
            background is in online support services providing support in retail accounting, commercial real estate
            underwriting, logistics, and canine rescue. I love learning new things and am excited about taking this
            class because I’ve long had an interest in learning to code and the stars have finally aligned for me to
            have an opportunity to do so!</p>

          <h5>About Dean</h5>
          <p>Hello, my name is Dean Weiss. I graduated Highschool in 2004 and enlisted in the Minnesota National Guard
            in 2006. Since then I have been in the military for over 15 years. My job experience primarily consists of
            working for the Minnesota National Guard in some capacity. Because my skillset revolves around the military
            my goal is to complete the suite of tasks here at CodeFellows and make my self marketable in the wider world
            as a coder.</p>
