          <h5>Irish</h5>
          <p>Irish is a 14 year old Chinook rescue that enjoys spending his days lounging around. Heâ€™s an old man in
            spirit and body, that likes things his particular way. He dislikes most other animals, except for cats, he
            loves cats. His favorite place to rest are wherever the people are and if you are not resting he will
            headbutt you with his thick skull to get your attention and lead you to where he wants to nap.</p>

          <h5>Mochi</h5>
          <p>Mochi is an 9 week old Lab and German Shorthaired Pointer mix. It's hard to find words to describe her
            crazy personality that would be considered professional. In the last few days she has dug her first hole,
            destroyed her first toy, jumped off a 4 foot wall, and managed to mark her territory all over my house.
            Considering her young age she is very quiet and well-behaved pup whilst supervised. In the future I plan to
            take her on my daily runs and weekend adventures in the mountains.</p>

          <img id="Greg" src="assets/greg-in-treeRS.jpg" alt="Cat Named Greg">
          <h5>Greg</h5>
          <p>Greg is a 7 year old orange tabby cat. He has been with Katharine since he was born. In his younger days he
            was man about town, roaming freely around outdoors during the day. After one too many fights and bird kills,
            he has since retired from the outdoor life. After a recent move, Greg has upgraded to a home with large
            windows all around. While his outdoor time is now limited to an enclosed cat patio.</p>

          <img id="ShelbyGang" src="assets/shelbyGangRS.jpg" alt="Four dogs and a cat">
          <h5>Tippy,Blanca,Harold,Bentley,Tenchi</h5>
          <p>Tippy is the loudest of the gang that takes care of Vida runs a tight ship securing the pantry. Blanca's
            serious intelligence tempered by Harold's good-natured goofiness. Bentley retired from a tech career in
            Seattle to the Carolinas to spend his golden years giving in whole-heartedly to his anxiety triggers and
            loudly demanding that his designated human stop all productive activity promptly at 9:00 PM (or he'll only
            get louder). Tenchi was the bestest kitty and Vida's rock for 21 years; sadly he passed away a few months
            ago and awaits her while frolicking at the rainbow bridge.</p>
