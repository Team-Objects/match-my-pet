get userName

function (userName) {  //satisfies pull from local storage requirement
if userName is present in localStorage then say "Welcome Back, userName! You're won ## games so far, let's add another to the count!"
    if userName is not present in local storage then do nothing

// definition of difficulty
if userDifficultySelection = Easy then numOfTrials is 15
else if userDifficultySelection = Med then numOfTrials is 10
else if userDifficultySelection = Hard then numOfTrials is 5

  the game is not over and varGameIsLive is true
      else !gameisLive (i.e. game over)
  
// scoring - we don't care about points, it's Pass/Fail time, Baby!!

// attend to the game board (build it and/or layout the cards)

// game initiation
   Define a button
   OnClick call playGame ()

// ongoing game play mechanic (relevant BusMall Code)
function(){
    while (numOfTrials > 0 && there are cards remaining) {
    user selects card, card flips, user selects 2nd card, card flips

    if cards match alert ("You got a match!")
        else both cards flip back over
    numOfTrials = -= numOfTrials
  }

if all cards are matched then
  alert ("Congrats you won!")
      winState = true;

if numOfTrials = 0 && there are cards remaining
  alert ("Aww you're all out of turns! Have a furkid hug & try again!")
      winState = false;

// local storage
Goal: put score in local storage and have it be persistent if user goes to a different page (per Audrey: "gameState" might be more advanced and not likely to work as well) - how many times has this user played the game, Audrey suggests storing userName and winCount as oppposed to score

push userName and winState to localStorageArr -- not sure of how this is structured refer to local Storage lab
